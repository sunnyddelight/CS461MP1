1 Using a HMAC helps us avoid length-extension vulnerability because the premise of the length-extension attack is that we can set the “internal state” of our encryption generator to whatever the MAC that is being used and then add onto the message and since we know the internal state, we can use that and generate our new MAC. The HMAC prevents this abuse by hashing the key, message pair twice so that we cannot simply append the message. 

2 This technique poses a threat to systems that verify installation because they will often support installing multiple files, and if we have the ability to append items to the end of the list of packages we want to install, then we can very easily tell the computer to install our own packages and generate a valid MAC. It offers us a way to insert our code into the system and thus is a very valid point of vulnerability. This is especially true, if like our case, we are filling the space with null characters or something that the system would not throw an error for.
